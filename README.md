# Calculator
Web-based calculator project 

This is a basic web based calculator to practice and improve my ability with Javascript.

- Current functionailty allows the user to do basic sums on a set of two numbers at a time. All operations will be complete before stringing any extra sums.

- Future features will include keyboard support and ironing out and edgecase bugs that sometimes occur.
